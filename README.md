# NIR Spectroscopy Prediction Model

## Problem Definition
### Problem
Use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to predict certain chemical or sensory data.

### Goal
The goal is to build a quantitative prediction model using NIR data to accurately forecast sensory or chemical properties.

## Dataset
### Modeling Dataset
This dataset contains both dependent variables (A, B, C, D, E, and Y) that we need to predict, and independent variables (spectral data from 3800 to 7377).

### Test Dataset
This dataset only contains independent variables (spectral data). The goal is to predict the dependent variables (A, B, C, D, E, and Y).
